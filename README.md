Document Similarity Using Python and AWS


Word Vectors


In simpler terms, a word vector is a row of real valued numbers (as opposed to dummy numbers) where each point captures a dimension of the word's meaning and where semantically similar words have similar vectors.



Cosine Distance 

Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space. It is defined to equal the cosine of the angle between them, which is also the same as the inner product of the same vectors normalized to both have length 1.


AWS Lambda


AWS Lambda is an event-driven, serverless computing platform provided by Amazon as a part of Amazon Web Services. It is a computing service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the computing resources required by that code. It was introduced in November 2014.
